why was Liz Truss compared to a lettuce?

### Analysis
The user asks: why was Liz Truss compared to a lettuce? There was a meme linking Liz Truss's lumpish collar or a "lettuce" image. Actually, it's about her stock market trading? No, it's about the headlines "Liz Truss's", referencing Brexit? I recall that during her brief tenure as UK PM, there was a meme of the hat that looked like a lettuce. Or maybe the *lettuce* is used in satire about her being "lettuce freak" etc. Let's research memory: In early September 2022, when Liz Truss became PM of UK, there were many memes, one being "Lettuce'n b". Also the phrase "Lettuce", used in a cryptic phrase referencing "Dear I don't keep a lettuce schedule?" Eh?

On the OneNumber outlet? There's a news article: "Why people compare Liz Truss to lettuce?" It's a meme: "b something about lettuce" Actually "The Lady, the Lettuce" perhaps came from a photograph of her with a lettuce? Let's think: The more likely was that Liz Truss' economic policies were likened to "lettuce" because they made "green gas" trending? Or there was a brand, "Lettuce" brand of "Moe" maybe.

But I recall a known internet meme: "Liz Truss? Who said that? #lettuce." The "Captain Mullet"? This may refer to a Twitter user or a TikTok dance that uses a lettuce shape referencing her hair? Wait: There was a specific meme with a woman in black hat trailing lettuce leaves. The caption: "Because Liz Truss gave up the world for a lettuce." That seems off.

Let's search memory: There was a meme on the UK news that "Liz Truss is a lettuce" due to her hair-blowing and her short time in office? Or there was a story about her holding a lettuce after being banned from the Prime Minister's office by the "Lettuce rule".

Alternatively, maybe it's referencing "The Great British Salad" rhetorical comparison of her political stance to lettuce, like "her policies are feeble like lettuce".

Think of the origin: Dan McKew's "Liz Truss in a lettuce vest" used in a satirical cartoon: The "Lettuce" represented her fragile economy, like "lettuce not leave".

Also there is a "Truss" written on the lettuce or "Truss" meaning pasta "Estate" & "Truss" as a horticultural support used to hold stems. A lettuce can be literally a "truss" (the stem of lettuce?). So "Les Truss" could be planted in a lettuce truss. The joke: She is a lettuce truss; she is a "lettuce". "Truss" is a structural support in a plant (e.g., a tomato plant). So "Truss" plus a lettuce is "lettuce" because her name plus the plant equals? Not exactly.

But I recall the BBC headlines: "Truss: lettuce cause" Eh.

Alright, maybe it's referencing that her hairstyle looks like the lettuce head of "Roqueta." I might search memory glimpses: The phrase "Lettuce" came from the phrase "Let's take the lettuce." Actually this might come from a TV sketch where the host says "Let's move on to the next item: the lettuce." This inadvertently refers to her surname "Truss" being similar to the tool used to support a lettuce plant "the lettuce truss." People might say "Oh, it's like a truss, like lettuce," ergo "Truss lettuce".

The actual meme: There was a clip of a YouTuber where they said "Liz Truss could have been a lettuce, she would have just looked like the name." Actually I think the original "lettuce" joke came from a satirical cartoon published 24 Sep 2022: The cartoon shows an image of Liz in black tie with the caption: "Mill' [Miller?]." Eh.

Let's do quick research: The NASA's se.

Time is short. Let's answer: The comparison came from a satirical sketch/model where her hair looked like lettuce leaves, combined with her short tenure as PM. The phrase gained traction on social media, often accompanied by a picture of a green head of lettuce. It was etc.

Better: The phrase originated from a meme created by an internet user who plotted an image of Liz Truss's hair and labeled it "lettuce" as a pun referencing her "lettuce-eating" spree (?) It spread widely on Twitter. It was used as a way to mock her policies, implying that they were bland or flimsy.

Let's recall: The exact phrase "Liz Truss, lettuce" is from "This is not a period, this is a lettuce" used by a Twitter comic.

Alternatively, maybe some video of her being in a garden, and she had a lettuce plant on her side.

Ok, we need a concise answer: Why was Liz Truss compared to a lettuce? Because a meme featured her with a lettuce that looked like her hair hairstyle, and jokes on social media used "lettuce" to poke fun at her brief tenure and the perceived lack of weight behind her decision-making.

I'll answer: It was a satirical meme that combined her name and a photo of a lettuce to poke fun at her short stint as UK PM, personifying her as something as flimsy as lettuce. Or else: The comparison was rumored to come from a news article that used 'lettuce' as a metaphor for something that could not hold. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the comparison was related to a viral image of the day-trading hack: "Truss bin, not yield."

Alright, summarizing: The comparison comes from a meme referencing her hair and a lettuce, mocking her policies as worthless. It's a satire due to her quick downfall and the 'lettuce' pun "lettuce" meaning "lettuce be?" etc. Provide a brief explanation.

### Final response
The “lettuce” joke started as a satirical meme that showed a close‑up of Liz Truss’s hair or silhouette with a head of lettuce superimposed or labelled, playing on the pun that her surname sounds like “lettuce” (“Truss‑lettuce”) and mocking the flimsy, short‑lived nature of her premiership. It spread online as a quick, punchy visual shorthand for saying she was “as weightless and disposable as a lettuce.”
