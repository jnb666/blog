### User
why was Liz Truss compared to a lettuce?

### Analysis
We need to answer concisely in one or two sentences. Explanation: Liz Truss compared to a lettuce because she lasted about as long in office as a lettuce's shelf-life, especially the "romaine lettuce challenge" where a lettuce was used to compare the length of her tenure. Provide that.

### Final response
She was likened to a lettuce because her brief, four‑week premiership was humorously compared to how quickly a lettuce wilts—highlighted by the viral “lettuce vs. Liz Truss” challenge that timed her tenure against a romaine’s shelf‑life.
